## Repository Structure

### 1. AoA Estimation
This directory contains the Python project for processing and estimating the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of acoustic signals.

- **Description**: The AoA estimation algorithm is implemented in Python and includes necessary scripts and datasets.
- **Usage**: Detailed instructions for running the AoA estimation process can be found in `AoA_estimation/readme.md`.

### 2. Comsol_Project
This directory contains the components and configuration optimization scripts for the system's acoustic metasurface (AMS) design.

- **Units**: The Comsol files represent the comsol model used in the AMS design.
- **Optimization**: `optimization.py` implements the optimization process for configuring the AMS to improve system performance.
